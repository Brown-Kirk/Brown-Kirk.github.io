		***Variables: Variables are placeholders. They can be numbers, strings, objects, boolean, null, or undefined.
		***Variables are always defined by putting "var" in front of the variable name.
		***To assign a value to a variable, you put an "=" followed by the value.
		***Initially, a variable can be declared and a value assigned, or it can be declared without a value.
		***Declaring without a value actually assigns the value "undefined".
		***Example "var variableName;" creates the variable "variableName" and assigns the value "undefined".
		***Example "var variableName = 12" creates the variable "variableName" and assigns the numerical value of 12.
		***In the example below, "valueList" is assigned the value "undefined", but specifies that this is an array.
		***More on arrays later

		/*
		***	Functions are a collection of actions that can be called from other areas of the script. These
		*** can perform any actions any other area of the script can, but are reusable. So you can call the function
		*** from other areas of the script, as many times as you want. In this case, the function "getValueInputs"
		*** gets the value entered into a text box, then takes that value to perform additional actions such as
		*** checking to see if it is a number, if it is between 1 and 100,000, and then passing it on to other functions.

			***Conditional Statements: Conditional statements define actions to take based upon the conditions present.
			***These can take several forms
			***		"if.. else"  - This statement checks to see if a condition is true. You can check for variables to be
			***			a certain value, greater than or less than a certain value, or even what type of value it is.
			***			In the example below, the code checks for 3 things and if all of them are true, it returns true.
			***			The three things are: Is the value anything besides a number, is the value less than 1, is the value
			***			greater than 100,000. As long as it meets any of these, the value is true. If any one of these is true,
			***			it returns true. (You could put "&&" where "||" is to mean it has to meet ALL criteria.)
			***			For example, the value "Bob" is not a number, so it would return true, and thus proceed to the true
			***			actions where it says the input is not valid. "-500" is less than 1, so it would do the same. 150,000
			***			is greater than 100000, so it would also. However, "50" causes it to return false because it does Not
			***			meet any of the criteria. In this case, we proceed with the "oddSum()" function. We could put "else if"
			***			where "else" is and add in another condition, if we wanted. There can be as many "else if" as you wanted
			***			but only 1 if and 1 else.

	<h2>JavaScript Examples</h2>
	<h3>Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Variables, Parameters, Arrays, Associative Arrays</h3>
	<p><b>This section shows the code in action. Simply put, we're intputting a number, then finding all the odd numbers
	etween 0 and the number inputted. Then we're adding those up to get the sum. Pointless, but it lets me use <thead>
	required components.</b></p>
		</thead>
	<p>In the box below, type a number that is between 1 and 100 into each of the boxes below, then click OK.</p>
	<p><input type="text" id="box1" size="3" value="0"> <button type="button" onclick="getValueInputs()" >OK</button></p>
	<p><div id="outputdiv"></div></p>
	<p><div id="outputdiv2"></div></p>
	<p><div id="outputdiv3"></div></p>
	<h3>Fluency components:</h3>
	<p><b>Loops:</b> Loops are used thorughout the script. The first example is where we loop through all of the numbers
	between 1 and the input number, adding the values of only the odd numbers.</p>
	<p><pre>	for (i = number1 ; i > 0; i--) {
	  if (i % 2 != 0) {
	    result = result + i;
	  }
	}</pre></p>
	<p>We also loop through an array. This is in the section where we are collecting all of the statements
	about "the sum of all the odd numbers between..." to list out all of the sums between 1 and the input number.</p>
	<p><pre>	for(var i in valueList) {
	  if(i > 0) {
	    valueListOutput = valueListOutput + "The sum of all the odd numbers between zero and " + i + " is " + valueList[i] + "." + '<br>';
	  }
	}</pre></p>
	<p><b>Conditional Statements:</b> Conditional statements can be found throughout the script as well. They are used
	to check for valid inputs:</p>
	<p><pre>	if (isNaN(number) || number < 1 || number > 100) {
	  resultOutput = "Input not valid. Please enter a number between 1 an 100.";
	  document.getElementById('outputdiv').innerHTML = resultOutput;
	  document.getElementById('outputdiv2').innerHTML = ""
	  document.getElementById('outputdiv3').innerHTML = "";
	} else {
	  oddSum(number);
	  oddList(number);
	}</pre></p>
	<p>Separate odd and even numbers:</p>
	<p><pre>	if (i % 2 != 0) {
	  result = result + i;
	}</pre></p>
	<p>Find the last number in a series:</p>
	<p><pre>	switch(i) {
	  case 1:
	    result = 1;
	    valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	    break;
	  case number2:
	    result = result + ", and " + i;
	    valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	    break;
	  case number2 - 1:
	    result = result + ", and " + i;
	    valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	    break;
	  default:
	    result = result + ", " + i;
	    valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	}</pre></p>
	<p><b>Functions:</b> There are several functions used in this code, some with parameters, and some without. I'll cover
	the ones with parameters in the parameter section. The only one without a parameter is the first one, "getValueInputs".
	This function gets the user's input, validates it, and then either says the input is invalid or sends it on to the next
	steps.</p>
	<p><pre>	function getValueInputs() {
	  var number = parseInt(document.getElementById('box1').value);
	  if (isNaN(number) || number < 1 || number > 100) {
	    resultOutput = "Input not valid. Please enter a number between 1 an 100.";
	    document.getElementById('outputdiv').innerHTML = resultOutput;
	    document.getElementById('outputdiv2').innerHTML = ""
	    document.getElementById('outputdiv3').innerHTML = "";
	  } else {
	    oddSum(number);
	    oddList(number);
	  }
	}</pre></p>
	<p><b>Variables:</b> Variables are one of the most frequent components of any script, since they're used as placeholders
	for values the script uses. I have several throughout my script, but a few examples are:</p>
	<p><pre>	var i = 1 ;</pre></p>
	<p>which declares a variable named "i" and assigns it the number 1. Also, </p>
	<p><pre>	var number = parseInt(document.getElementById('box1').value);</pre></p>
	<p>which declares the variable "number" and takes the number from the text box and assigns it. And then there is this one:</p>
	<p><pre>	valueListOutput = valueListOutput + "The sum of all the odd numbers between zero and " + i + " is " + valueList[i] + "." + '<br>';</pre></p>
	<p>which takes an already declared variable, and the sentence listed to what's aleady assigned in that variable. Another common
	variable action is this one:</p>
	<p><pre>i++</pre></p>
	<p>which takes a numeric variable and increases it by 1. So if "i" equals 5, and it does "i++", then the new value is 6.</p>
	<p><b>Parameters:</b> Parameters are values that are passed into a function. Remember above where we declared the variable
	"number" and assigned it a value? Well, what we did next was to pass that value into two functions.<p>
	<p><pre>	oddSum(number);
oddList(number);</pre></p>
	<p>If we follow that into the function, we can see what happens with that variable:</p>
	<p><pre>	function oddSum(number1) {
	  var i = 1 ;
	  var result = 0;
	  if (number1 < 1 ) {
	    return 0;
	  }
	  for (i = number1 ; i > 0; i--) {
	    if (i % 2 != 0) {
	      result = result + i;
	    }
	  }
	  resultOutput = "The sum of all the odd numbers between zero and " + number1 + " is " + result + "."
	  document.getElementById('outputdiv').innerHTML = resultOutput;
	}</pre></p>
	<p>The "number" variable that was passed into the function becomes the new variable "number1" and is used throughout the
	function.</p>
	<p><b>Arrays:</b> We use an array when we're collecting the sums of all of the odd numbers:</p>
	<p><pre>	var valueList = [];
	for (i = 1 ; i <= number2; i++) {
	  if (i % 2 != 0) {
	    switch(i) {
	      case 1:
	        result = 1;
	        valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	        break;
	      case number2:
	        result = result + ", and " + i;
	        valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	        break;
	      case number2 - 1:
	        result = result + ", and " + i;
	        valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	        break;
	      default:
	        result = result + ", " + i;
	        valueList[i] = oddSumList(i);
	    }
	  } else {
	    if (i < number2) {
	      valueList[i] = valueList[i-1];
	    }
	  }
	}</pre></p>
	<p>Based on this code, it is processing through several conditions, and then assigning a value to one of the elements
	of the array. Later, process through the array and retrieve those values:</p>
	<p><pre>	for(var i in valueList) {
	  if(i > 0) {
	    valueListOutput = valueListOutput + "The sum of all the odd numbers between zero and " + i + " is " + valueList[i] + "." + '<br>';
	  }
	}</pre></p>
